ğŸ’¡ **What is it?**  
In OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts, you will see `uint256[50] private __gap;`. This is called a **storage gap**.  

ğŸš¨ **Why is it needed?**  
When upgrading a contract, **you cannot change the order of storage variables**. If you add a new variable in the middle, it will overwrite existing data. This can **break the contract**!  

âœ… **Solution:**  
The `__gap` array **reserves empty storage slots**. Later, if you upgrade the contract and need new variables, you can **use these reserved slots** instead of modifying the storage layout.  

ğŸ›  **How it works:**  
Each `uint256` takes **one slot** (32 bytes). `uint256[50]` reserves **50 slots** in storage. So when upgrading, new variables can **safely replace these reserved slots** without affecting old data. ğŸš€
