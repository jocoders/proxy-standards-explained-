The **OpenZeppelin upgrade tool for Hardhat** protects against **6 common mistakes** when upgrading smart contracts. These mistakes can break the contract, cause loss of funds, or make the upgrade impossible:

---

### **1️⃣ Changing the Order of Storage Variables**  
💡 **What is it?**  
If you change the order of state variables, the data will be mixed up.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
A variable that was `owner` before could now be `balance`. This would break the logic of the contract.

✅ **Solution:**  
Always **add** new variables at the **end** of the storage layout.

---

### **2️⃣ Changing the Type of a Storage Variable**  
💡 **What is it?**  
If you change `uint256` to `string`, the data stored in that variable will become invalid.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
Your contract may read the wrong data type, causing unexpected behavior or breaking the contract.

✅ **Solution:**  
**Never change** the type of an existing variable.

---

### **3️⃣ Using a Constructor Instead of an Initializer**  
💡 **What is it?**  
Constructors **only run once** when a contract is deployed. But a proxy contract **never runs constructors**.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
If you put logic inside a constructor, it **will never execute** in a proxy, meaning important setup like setting the `owner` or initial values won’t happen.

✅ **Solution:**  
Use an **initializer function** instead of a constructor.

```solidity
function initialize() public initializer { 
    owner = msg.sender; 
}
```

---

### **4️⃣ Adding New Variables Before Old Ones**  
💡 **What is it?**  
If you insert new variables **in the middle** of the contract, they will overwrite existing data.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
For example, if you insert `uint256 newValue;` before an old variable `address owner;`, the stored owner address will become **corrupted**.

✅ **Solution:**  
Always add new variables at the **end** of the contract.

---

### **5️⃣ Forgetting to Call Parent Initializers**  
💡 **What is it?**  
If a contract inherits from another contract, it must **manually call** the parent’s `initialize` function.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
If you forget this, the parent contract will not be set up properly.

✅ **Solution:**  
Always call the parent `initialize` function.

```solidity
function initialize() public initializer {
    ParentContract.initialize();
    myVariable = 10;
}
```

---

### **6️⃣ Not Locking the Implementation Contract**  
💡 **What is it?**  
If an attacker finds the **implementation contract**, they can call functions directly on it.

🚨 **Why does it matter?**  
This allows hackers to take control or modify storage in unexpected ways.

✅ **Solution:**  
Use `_disableInitializers();` in the constructor of the implementation contract.

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

---

### **🔥 Summary: Why Do These Mistakes Matter?**
- They **break the contract** or mix up storage.
- They **make upgrades impossible** or cause unexpected behavior.
- They **allow attackers** to exploit unprotected contracts.

### **✅ How to Avoid These Mistakes?**
- Always **use an initializer**, not a constructor.
- Always **add variables at the end**.
- Always **lock the implementation contract**.
- Always **call parent initializers**.
- **Never change** the order or type of storage variables.
