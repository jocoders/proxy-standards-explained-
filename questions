## âœ… If a proxy calls an implementation, and the implementation self-destructs in the function that gets called, what happens?

- **Short Answer:** The proxy continues to work, as `selfdestruct` no longer removes contract code after Cancun (EIP-6780).

- **Explanation:**
  1. `selfdestruct` **does not remove** code if the contract was deployed in a previous transaction.
  2. Only **storage is cleared**, but `delegatecall` does not use implementation storage.
  3. The proxy still works, even if the implementation self-destructs.
